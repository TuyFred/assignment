2. String Manipulation Functions
PHP provides several built-in functions for manipulating strings.

2.1 strpos() – Finding a Substring Position
The strpos() function returns the position of a substring inside a string.



Explanation:
"PHP" starts at index 7 (zero-based index).
If the string isn't found, strpos() returns false.

2.2 substr() – Extracting Part of a String
The substr() function extracts a substring from a given string.

Explanation:
substr($text, 0, 11) extracts from index 0 to 10.
Returns "Programming".

2.3 explode() – Splitting a String into an Array
The explode() function splits a string into an array based on a delimiter.

Explanation:
explode(",", $text) splits "apple,banana,orange" into an array.
Each fruit becomes an array element
