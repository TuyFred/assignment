PHP Super Global Variables
PHP provides several built-in superglobal variables that are always accessible, regardless of scope. Below are the key superglobal variables:

1. $_POST (Capturing Form Data)
It is used to collect form data sent via the POST method.
It does not append data to the URL, making it more secure than $_GET.


Explanation:
The form uses method="POST", and the input data is sent to post_process.php.
The htmlspecialchars() function prevents XSS attacks.
If $_POST is empty, it will show "No data received."
