1. Abstract Classes & Interfaces
Abstract classes and interfaces help define a common structure for different classes.

1.1 Abstract Classes
An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
It may contain abstract methods (without implementation).
Child classes must implement all abstract methods.


Explanation:
Animal is abstract, so it cannot be instantiated.
Dog must implement makeSound().

1.2 Interfaces
Interfaces only contain method signatures (no implementation).
A class can implement multiple interfaces.

Explanation:
Cat implements both Animal and Pet.
Multiple interfaces allow flexibility
