1. Regular Expressions in PHP
Regular expressions (regex) are used to search, match, and replace patterns in strings. 
PHP provides functions like preg_match() and preg_replace() for regex operations.

1.1 preg_match() – Checking if a String Matches a Pattern
The preg_match() function searches for a pattern in a string and 
returns 1 if found, 0 otherwise.

Explanation:
/^Hello/i:
^ → Matches the start of the string.
i → Case-insensitive match.
Returns "Match found!" because "hello" starts with "Hello" (ignoring case).

1.2 preg_replace() – Replacing a Pattern in a String
The preg_replace() function replaces all occurrences of 
a pattern with a replacement string.

Explanation:
"Java" is replaced everywhere in the string.
"JavaScript" also gets partially replaced (Java → PHP).
