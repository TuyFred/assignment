2. Encapsulation & Access Modifiers
Encapsulation hides data and controls access using access modifiers.

Access Modifiers:
public → Accessible everywhere.
protected → Accessible within class & subclasses.
private → Accessible only within class.

Explanation:
$balance is private, cannot be accessed directly.
Methods deposit() and getBalance() control access.
