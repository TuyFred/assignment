2. Final Classes & Methods (final)

final keyword prevents a class from being inherited or a method from being overridden.
When a class is marked as final, it cannot be extended.
A final method cannot be overridden in derived classes.

Explanation:
The Vehicle class is declared as final, so it cannot be inherited.
If you try to extend a final class (like the commented-out Car class), it will throw an error.
