1. Constants in Classes (const)

Constants are variables that cannot be changed once defined.
const in classes allows you to define constant values within a class
that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.

Explanation:
const PI = 3.14159; defines a constant within the class.
self::PI is used to access the constant in the method calculateArea().
